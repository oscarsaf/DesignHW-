## Preparation
To prepare for this lesson, I made sure my WSL & Ubuntu was functioning and that my password and username were created. 
## Contribution
I showed up to lecture, brought my yellow/blue card, and proceeded to listen about checkup one. Took notes on Linux and GNU
## GNU 
Contains compilers for C, C++, to edit kernels.
## Dual Boot
Not any more because boot process changes
## Virtual Machine
VM - Used to use VirtualBox instead of windows WSL 
## Old Hardware
Lightweight versions of Ubuntu brings back old machines to life.
## Licenses
"Shipping out binary" - After compiled, executable, shared libraries used in executions
In GNU Limits usability
Anything from GNU must be published including headers.
TiVo - Was based on LINUX -Used GNU- Did not follow License SO got in trouble
GNU -General Public License Skim
MIT License - Give credit.
Value of code - Intellectual, Commercial --ease of access and modification gives value.
## Useful Commands for Ubuntu
apt - aptitude
sudo apt install octave
sudo apt update 
Look up Ubuntu Science Software.
Pioneers: find because similar to Catan.vs
Start Octave: type octave
## Libre Office
Libre- Free, Word editor/ 1997 Simpler
More intuitive than word
## VSCode
Remove Brockhoff version of VSCode and use the default
DO Before next week.
## Muddy Water
It is now the second day so my prepwork and setup of my system is hopefully adequate. But I am concerned that I may run into an issue 
## Next Week Prep
linux has to be ready -- Ubuntu
Skim the Linux command line pg 1-124
Start a cheat sheet of the commands that appear to be useful. FIll in the details on the fly or in person.

# M 08/26/22
## Preparation
Created a Github Account.
Played around with the Linux Command Line
## Before Lecture
Have a machine with Linux installed
Read Linux and the GNU System (Links to an external site.)
Skim GNU General Public License (Links to an external site.)
Skim MIT License (Links to an external site.)
Skim Qt and its Open-Source License Option
## During Lecture
Address any issues with Linux installation.
Discuss origin of Linux (the kernel) and GNU (the operating system).
Install one or more open-source packages using the software manager or the apt utility.
Install VS Code. Students who have VS Code from ME 400 may have issues unless a new version is installed.
## Next Week Prep
Start working on HW #1 on Github
Code is trivial
The process is what is important

# 08/29/2022
## Preparation
Skimmed the 125 page reading which was interesting but I  need to dive deeper into it for a second run.
## Things to ask professor Roberts
VSCode - Full uninstall.
## Prepare for next session
Try to get myself as prepared as possible before class so I do not hold up the class on small issues. For the most part I just need to become more organized in my notes and not have stuff strewn about on my computer.
Fresh install of VSCode
Dig deeper into the reading and resources 
Linux Command Line 1-125 still

# 08/31/2022

## Preparation
Read some of the Linux Command Line. 
Did a fresh Install of VSCode.
I am not on the ball today because I am stressing out over dropping Nuclear Shielding.

## Big Takeaways
I learned that the terminal that we use for WSL uses bash
Bash has a large amount of user interaction.
Learned that Python is now the largest code language used.
Web developers and IT use Javascript.
Python will be used for quite some time.

## After Class
Start HW Problems and try to document in a legible form how and where I got my answers.
